# The Role of Anthropomorphism during Failure Events caused by Robo-Advisors
This is the public Github repo of my MSc thesis. Within this framework, reproducibility should be as good as possible.

The for the thesis relevant R scripts are the following:
- plsPath4.R, which is the code for the final model of the study
- abbreviationTable.R, which summarises the abbreviations
- dataPreparation.R, which prepares the data and puts them into the form, where it is ready for analysis
- constructs.R unifies and prepares the constructs for the analysis
- descriptiveAnalyis.R contains some tables and graphs
- CorrelationTestExpDisconfirm.R is the correlation test for the halo effect
- cronbachsAlpha.R calculates the Cronbach's alpha for the constructs and also takes care of the randomisation check

Within the data folder, the anonymised research data can be found.

The folder Supplementary Materials contains all the materials with a markdown file and respective pdf, which documents the data analysis process.
